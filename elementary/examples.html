Supplementary Material for Evaluation of the Elementary Ontology
----------------------------------------------------------------

The Ontology
------------

The ontology can be referred to or downloaded here: http://w3id.org/elementary

The ontology bridges to Brick, TSO, and OntoCape which are required if SPARQL queries refer to the classes and relationship contained in these.


Example Ontology of HVAC Stereotypes
------------------------------------

Component stereotypes for common HVAC components (for e.g., corresponding to brick:HVAC_Equipment) can be found here.
They can be referred to by components in a system description https://raw.githubusercontent.com/codepasta/autonomous-buildings/main/elementary/examples/hvac-v2.owl

SPARQL Queries
--------------

1. Use Case - 1: Find the connection point of a component stereotype which manipulates a process variable and dependent variable which will be affected:

PREFIX elem: <http://www.w3id.org/elementary#>
SELECT * WHERE {
    ?cs a elem:Stereotype.
    ?cs elem:hasPhysicalMechanism ?m.
    ?m elem:hasDependentVariable ?dv.
    ?m elem:hasManipulatedVariable ?mv.
    ?cs elem:hasConnectionPoint ?cp.
    ?cp elem:manipulates ?mv.
}
